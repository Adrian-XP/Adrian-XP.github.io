The design centers on the Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, which manages sensor input, signal processing, and output control. Power is supplied by a 5V 1.5A LM7805T voltage regulator, ensuring stable operation for all components. A Photonix NSL-5162 photoresistor detects ambient light levels, and its analog output is amplified by an MCP6004-I/P operational amplifier before being read by the microcontroller\u2019s ADC input (RA0). The microcontroller processes this signal to determine the light intensity and control the system's behavior. A PWM signal from pin RC2 drives an LED indicator, while a digital input on RD1 receives input from a push button for manual control. Communication between this board and the team\u2019s other modules is handled through an 8-pin connector, where pins 1\u20134 carry digital signals and pins 5\u20138 handle analog lines. Overall, the subsystem translates light intensity into actionable control signals, maintaining consistent power and reliable communication within the team\u2019s modular design.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#adrians-individual-block-diagram","title":"Adrian's Individual Block Diagram","text":"<p>This block diagram can be found as a PDF here</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>Op-amp</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. MCP6004-I/P$0.59/eachlink to product * Rail-to-rail I/O* 1.8\u20135.5 V supply* Low quiescent current* Good for sensors, buffers, or filters * 1 MHz GBW (not for high-speed) * Limited output drive * Option 2. * TLV9004IDR * $.69/each * Link to product * Rail-to-rail * 1.8\u20135.5 V  * Many footprints * Often SMD only * Similar 1 MHz GBW * Availability varies * Option 3. * LM324N * $.24/each * Link to product * Inexpensive * Dual In-line Package  * Present everywhere * Not rail-to-rail * Input common-mode limits can bite at 3.3 V * Vout can\u2019t hit 3.3 V rails <p>Choice: Option 1: MCP6004-I/P</p> <p>Rationale: Runs happily at 3.3 V, rail-to-rail I/O, low Iq, DIP package for quick breadboard/proto. It hits the sensor-signal conditioning needs without SMD headaches or excess cost.</p> <p>Linear Regulator</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. LM7805T$0.33/eachlink to product * 5 V fixed * Up to ~1 A with heatsinking* easy to design with * Big dropout (~2 V): needs \u22657 V in * Poor efficiency vs switchers* Watch thermals * Option 2. * MC7805CTG * $.52/each * Link to product * Same behavior * Widely available  * Same dropout/thermal limits * Option 3. * AMS1117-5.0 * $.12/each * Link to product * Compact * Inexpensive * High dropout (~1.1\u20131.3 V * Only ~800 mA * Thermal headroom limited <p>Choice: Option 1: LM7805T</p> <p>Rationale: 5 V rail for lab bricks \u22657\u20139 V input. The design time is near zero, and sourcing is painless.
