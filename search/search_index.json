Sensor: a potentiometer sends an analog 0\u20133.3 V signal into RA0/ADC1, and Button 1 is a digital/parallel 3.3 V input to the Digital I/O block. Actuator: A red LED is driven by PWM on RC2 (3.3 V) for brightness feedback. Team connections: the standardized 8-pin connector exposes this board\u2019s signal pins 1-5 digital, pins 6\u20138 analog\u2014and, per the team plan, Mihir\u2019s hub board reads Adrian\u2019s potentiometer (analog over pins 6\u20137) while Adrian keeps local digital (button/LED) to minimize cross-board dependencies; Zane\u2019s DAC also feeds Mihir. Power source: This board assumes a regulated 3.3 V supply (from USB or a team regulator) for the MCU and LED, while any higher-voltage motor/H-bridge power is handled on Mihir\u2019s board; only the necessary analog lines, plus a shared ground, cross the ribbon to keep wiring simple and noise levels low. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#adrians-individual-block-diagram","title":"Adrian's Individual Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>Op-amp</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. MCP6004-I/P$0.59/eachlink to product * Rail-to-rail I/O* 1.8\u20135.5 V supply* Low quiescent current* Good for sensors, buffers, or filters * 1 MHz GBW (not for high-speed) * Limited output drive * Option 2. * TLV9004IDR * $.69/each * Link to product * Rail-to-rail * 1.8\u20135.5 V  * Many footprints * Often SMD only * Similar 1 MHz GBW * Availability varies * Option 3. * LM324N * $.24/each * Link to product * Inexpensive * Dual In-line Package  * Present everywhere * Not rail-to-rail * Input common-mode limits can bite at 3.3 V * Vout can\u2019t hit 3.3 V rails <p>Choice: Option 1: MCP6004-I/P</p> <p>Rationale: Runs happily at 3.3 V, rail-to-rail I/O, low Iq, DIP package for quick breadboard/proto. It hits the sensor-signal conditioning needs without SMD headaches or excess cost.</p> <p>Linear Regulator</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. LM7805T$0.33/eachlink to product * 5 V fixed * Up to ~1 A with heatsinking* easy to design with * Big dropout (~2 V): needs \u22657 V in * Poor efficiency vs switchers* Watch thermals * Option 2. * MC7805CTG * $.52/each * Link to product * Same behavior * Widely available  * Same dropout/thermal limits * Option 3. * AMS1117-5.0 * $.12/each * Link to product * Compact * Inexpensive * High dropout (~1.1\u20131.3 V * Only ~800 mA * Thermal headroom limited <p>Choice: Option 1: LM7805T</p> <p>Rationale: 5 V rail for lab bricks \u22657\u20139 V input. The design time is near zero, and sourcing is painless. If the input headroom is tight, it can be replaced with an LM2940-5.0.</p> <p>Photoresistor</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.Adafruit Photo Cell$0.95/eachlink to product * Well-documented * Simple to integrate in a 3.3 V divider* Small and inexpensive * Not super high precision*Typical resistance ranges* May need calibration * Option 2. *Photonix\u202fNSL\u20115162 CDS Photoresistor* $1.06/each * Link to product *Good industrial pedigree*Known performance specs *Radial through-hole *Slightly higher cost*More specs than needed*Adjustment to the ambient light threshold more than originally intended * Option 3. * Photonix\u202fPDV\u2011P5001 CDS Photoresistor* $1.54/each * Link to product * Larger sensor area (11 mm)*Could give stronger signal for low-light situations * Bigger package* Might require different mounting / sensor housing <p>Choice: Option 2: Photonix\u202fNSL\u20115162 CDS Photoresistor</p> <p>Rationale: The NSL-5162 CdS photoresistor was chosen because it offers precise, repeatable light-to-resistance characteristics backed by a detailed datasheet and stable manufacturing. Its wide dynamic range and reliable performance at 3.3 V make it a better long-term, spec-driven choice for consistent ambient-light sensing than hobby-grade LDRs.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
