title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
After selecting components in the Component Selection phase, we needed to ensure that the subsection would have sufficient power, including an additional safety margin. To achieve this, we focused on the active components, excluding switches and passive components, and confirmed that our power supply and regulators could provide the required power.

## Conclusions

Creating the power budget has highlighted the power requirements of my subsystem. Since I have only three components in my subsystem, my power requirements are quite low. I am exclusively using a +5V rail, making my design relatively simple. My Photoresistor consumes a small amount of current, and my op-amp also draws very little current. Based on the power budget, I have determined that I have more than enough power for my components when using the voltage regulator we have been using in class.
