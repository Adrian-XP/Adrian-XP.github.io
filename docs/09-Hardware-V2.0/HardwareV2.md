## Version 2.0

If I were to develop a version 2.0 of my design, I would focus on several significant areas for improvement. Firstly, I prioritize the organization of my PCB. In the current design, the connector points are scattered throughout the board, which not only complicates the layout but also increases the risk of mistakenly reassigning different pins. A more structured approach to the layout would enhance both functionality and ease of troubleshooting, allowing for a cleaner and more efficient design process. Additionally, I would source the manufacturer's specific footprints for the components I am utilizing if possible. The 304 teaching team encouraged us to create our own custom footprints, which is a valuable exercise, but having access to verified footprints from manufacturers would have streamlined this process considerably. Websites like Digikey are excellent resources as they offer datasheets and manufacturer-provided footprints for many components. If I had known about these resources earlier, it could have saved me a significant amount of time and effort in verifying that the footprint would correctly match the part specifications. This additional layer of verification would not only reduce the likelihood of errors but also enhance the overall quality of the design.
