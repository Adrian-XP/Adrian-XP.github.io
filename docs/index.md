## Introduction

* This datasheet is for the photoresistor subsection of the automatic curtain raiser project. The pages of this datasheet will walk through some of the design decisions, project criteria, and various project elements to simulate professional documentation.

### Project Summary

* The goal of the project is to create a system that interacts with other individual subsystems to provide a function that makes the user's life easier. The task Team 206 identified was the tedious task of managing curtains for a room. This was broken down into three subsystems: motion sensing, temperature sensing, and light sensing. You are currently viewing the moisture sensing subsection. The other sections are available via the [team report.](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-206.github.io/EGR304-TechMinds/). 


### My Contribution

* This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction
* Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest. Information like:

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
